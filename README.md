# React + Vite Monster Hunter Proyect Page

This is a personal project currently under development using React + Vite.
It utilizes a database from (https://github.com/gatheringhallstudios/MHWorldData/tree/master), for which I generated an API to connect to my project.
The currently available pages are Items and Monster, both displaying their respective data along with their logos.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
